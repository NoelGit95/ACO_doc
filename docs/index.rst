About
-------
Researchers in the environmental social sciences, broadly construed, are increasingly studying behavior
in paradigms with actual environmental consequences. While studying peopleâ€™s willingness to invest in
environmental public goods, many experimentalists rely on emission certificate markets to purchase and
retire certificates to limit the caps in cap-and-trade regulated markets. Thereby, experimental decisions
trigger actual environmental consequences.

Our software-module helps researchers using `oTree <https://otree.readthedocs.io>`_ to automate
the process of purchasing and retiring emission certificates in experiments. When an experiment
is finished, researchers receive an email and are directed to a customized donation form
of `Compensators.org <https://www.compensators.org/>`_, a platform facilitating the purchase and
retirement of certificates. The tool helps researchers to purchase emission certificates with
minimal effort, thereby reducing the entry cost for conducting experiments with environmental
consequences.

This website provides simple step by step instructions that show researchers how to integrate the
software module in their *oTree* projects.

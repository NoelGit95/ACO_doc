About
^^^^^^

- The Carbon Emission Task (CET) as a new paradigm grounded in experimental economics to assess actual pro-environmental behavior
- The CET can be used in laboratory, online, or classroom studies.
- Participants face repeated tradeoffs between financial bonus opportunities paired with real carbon emissions and foregoing such opportunities while staying carbon-neutral.

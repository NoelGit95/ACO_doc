Documentation of the Automatic Carbon Offsetting software module.

## Automatic Carbon Offsetting
Our software-module helps researchers using oTree to automate the process of purchasing and retiring emission certificates in experiments.
When an experiment is finished, researchers receive an email and are directed to a customized donation form of Compensators.org,
a platform facilitating the purchase and retirement of certificates. The tool helps researchers to purchase emission certificates with minimal effort,
thereby reducing the entry cost for conducting experiments with environmental consequences.

Check [ACO Documentation](https://aco-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for simple step by step instructions that show researchers how to integrate the software module in their oTree projects.
